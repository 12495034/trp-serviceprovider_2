# Rapid HIV & Syphillis Clinic scheduling and management system

The Rainbow Project is the largest LGBT charity in Nothern Ireland, who offer a variety of services to the LGBT community. One such service is rapid HIV and Syphillus testing. A system was developed to enable The Rainbow project to schedule rapid HIV testing clinics at specific test centers within the City of Belfast. 
This project has focused on the developement of the service provider aspect of the system. A React js web application was developed using as Firebase back end for user authentication and data storage. Communication between the Service-Provider part of the system and the service user occurs entirely through the Firestore database. firestore snapshot listeners were employed for real time data update facilitating an immediate render of user actions within the system.

This aspect of the project is only acessible to Rainbow Project Staff as sensitive information about service users is accessible.
As such this project is not currently accepting contributions. However, this may change in the future. 

## System Overview
1. Front End - React JS
2. UI framework - React Boostrap
3. Backend - Firebase Auth and firestore

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

<!-- ## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
